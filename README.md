C3-fmt
======


My version of C++'s fmt library writen in C3 not as good and still a work in progress but it works, much testing still needed. see [examples/](examples/) for working usage and the libraries are [io.c3l/format.c3](io.c3l/format.c3) and [io.c3l/format_private.c3](io.c3l/format_private.c3) and the various depedacies are in [src/](src/) for now 😉 
it's a work in progress 🤠.
